# Math 5620 Explicit Euler Method

**Routine Name:**           euler.cpp

**Author:** Raul Ramirez

**Description/Purpose:** 
This program was designed to help us compute problem number 4 on Assignment 4.

**Input:** 
The user will give no inputs as this is all handled internally by the program. The user will simply need to type *./euler* after they have compiled it. The Euler method has been added to the Utilities folder as a method to use.

**Output:** 
This program will output a single double with the solution

**Code:**
```cpp
int main()
{
	std::cout << Euler << std::endl;
	printSolution(euler());
	
}
```
**Result**
```
Euler:
-2.05836
```
